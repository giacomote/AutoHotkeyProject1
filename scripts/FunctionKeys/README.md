# MouseRemote
A script that lets you use some specific controls (e.g. Play/Pause for the music) even if your keyboard does not have a
specific key for them.

## 💻 Using the script
After launching the application, you are able to use the following controls.

| Key Combination | Control |
| --------------- | ------- |
| Play/Pause      | Alt + K |

### Usage notes
- The script can be launched in a silent mode (without sending the notification at startup) using `-s` or `--silent`
  options.
