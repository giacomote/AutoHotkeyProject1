# ProcessGetInfo
A script that lets you know process name and window title related to a specific window.

## 💻 Using the script
After launching the script, press `Ctrl + Win` and click on a window. The script will tell you the relative information.

### Usage notes
- The script can be launched in a silent mode (without sending the notification at startup) using `-s` or `--silent`
  options.
- ProcessInfo will work also clicking on an inactive window (and it will activate the window).
